# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling and non-descriptive error responses.

The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches a user by ID.  It lacks crucial checks for invalid input (e.g., non-numeric user IDs) and doesn't provide informative error messages to the client when an error occurs.  A simple `404` status code isn't very useful for debugging.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, including input validation and more descriptive responses.  It handles the case where a user is not found with a clear error message, making debugging easier and providing a better user experience.

## How to reproduce the bug:
1. Run `bug.js`.
2. Make a GET request to `/users/abc` (invalid ID).
3. Observe the response; it's just a 404 with no useful information. 

## How to test the solution:
1. Run `bugSolution.js`
2. Make the same request `/users/abc`
3. The response now contains detailed error information, allowing for effective debugging and more informative client-side error handling.
